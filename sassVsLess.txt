SASS comes from Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets while LESS means Leaner Style Sheets
SASS is written in Ruby LESS in Javascript
Both prep-processors fas features lile  variables, mixins and funtions.
variables in Less are defined with "@" and in Sass with "$"
           
SASS mixin example:                            |     LESS mixin example :
     - @mixin myMixin { background: red}       |        - .myMixin { background : red}
     - in order to use the mixin in is         |        -  Less handles execution of the mixin in a 
       necessary to import it with             |           slighly different way ".myMixin()"
       "@import myMixin"

when explicit circumstances occur.   

- SASS empowers you to make your own capacity and use them with the setting client needs.
 We can call functions by utilizing the function name with parameters.SASS offers loops and case differentiations
